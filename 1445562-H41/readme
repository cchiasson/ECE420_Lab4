Overview:
    There are four groups of scripts in this project
    

    Main files created by us for lab 4:
    main_attempt1.c	First attempt with MPI using MPI_Gather and MPI_Bdcast. Will compile to main_attempt1.
    main_attempt2.c	Second attempt to optimize first attempt using MPI_Allgather. Will compile to main.
    Makefile		The makefile will compile the main_attempt1.c, main_attempt2.c, serialtester, and datatrim files. 

-----
    Data selection program and original data:
    web-Standford.txt	original data
    datatrim.c          source file to fetch a subset of the original data and pre-process it

-----
    Important functions:
    timer.h        macro definition for the time measurement
    Lab4IO.h       header for the Lab4IO.c, needs to be included if call the IOs directly from Lab4IO.c
    Lab4IO.c       source file for the IO functions, needs to be referred in the compiler line if the functions are called in the program

-----
    Verification program:
    serialtester.c source file for the testing program, depending on the Lab4IO.c
	check.sh	the script used for in-lab marking, should be in the same directory as the exacutables (datatrim, serialtester and main).
